# Typescript

Javascript is dynamically typed, which means it doesn't know what type things are until runtime.
Typescript is statically types, which means everything has a type before it is compiled.

### Install
Run `npm i -g typescript`
Run `tsc -v` to see the version number 

The basic types in Typescript are **String**, **Number**, and **Boolean**.
