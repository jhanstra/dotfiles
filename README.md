## how this repo works

Files with `.symlink` get symlinked as dotfiles to your home folder. Files with `.zsh` get loaded into your zsh shell when it starts. The files in `zsh-setup/` are fancy bash scripts that make your terminal prompt look nice.

## how to

**add to path**
If you need to add a folder to your path, open `config/_path.zsh` and edit the `PATH` export.

> My aliases aren't working.

Have you opened up a new tab? Is your alias written in the correct format? e.g. `alias md='mkdir'` with no spaces?
